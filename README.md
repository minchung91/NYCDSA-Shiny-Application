# NYCDSA Shiny

This Shiny application is a preliminary study on the human interest in celebrities and their endorsements measured by Google search term counts. More specifically, the application focuses on five celebrity rappers with varying lengths of careers and varying levels of fame. This application is a work-in-progress and has potential to become more sophisticated with more data.

The possible applications include:
- targeting merchandise sales for certain areas in the US
- targeting shows and appearances for artists
- gauging the success of celebrity endorsements when they post on social media
- gauging correlations of things that happen to celebrities and the increase in interest from Google searches
- Did the celebrity succeed in bringing awareness to a certain cause?
- Did the celebrity endorsement work, and increase sales in a certain product?
